    HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

    Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

    With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code.

    Comments can be used to hide content.
    This can be helpful if you want to hide content temporarily.

    You can also hide more than one line.  Everything between the <!- and the -> will be hidden from the display.

    Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.

    Comments can also be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.
