What is an HTML Element?

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>

HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag

<h1> My First Heading </h1>
<p> My first paragraph. </p>

<h1> : Start tag
Element content 
</h1> : End tag

<p> : Start tag
My first paragraph. 
</p>
-->

<!-- 
 Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

<!--
 Web Browsers

 The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge,  Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
 A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.
-->

<!-- 
 The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
